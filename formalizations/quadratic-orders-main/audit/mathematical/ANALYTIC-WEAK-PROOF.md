# The analytic weak-supply route in the frozen round-five candidate

This document gives a traditional mathematical proof of the analytic chain represented by the frozen Lean sources. It ends with the prime-specific implication from positive upper Dirichlet supply to cofinal logarithmic mass of actual fixed-density good dyadic bins. It also records how that result enters the all-conductor arithmetic and finite-sieve assembly.

All source references below are read-only references to `../../project/lean/`. No candidate source, object, cache, or ZIP was changed while preparing this document. No compilation was run for this review document.

The analytic arguments through the real Euler-logarithm identity apply to **every number field**. The identification of unramified rational-prime coefficients with a complete-splitting indicator additionally requires the extension over `ℚ` to be **Galois**. The all-order principal-generator assembly additionally fixes a quadratic number field and a **positive conductor**. These assumptions are kept separate throughout.

## 1. Genuine coefficients and the zero index

Let $K$ be a number field, let $O_K$ be its ring of integers, and write $m=[K:\mathbb Q]\geq1$. For an integral ideal $I\subseteq O_K$, let $NI$ denote its actual absolute norm. Put

\[
a_K(n)=\#\{I\subseteq O_K:NI=n\}.
\]

The ideal norm fibers are finite. This is the raw coefficient used in mathlib's Dedekind zeta definition, not a coefficient replaced by a model sequence. In particular,

\[
a_K(0)=1,\qquad a_K(1)=1.
\]

The first equality counts the zero ideal: $NI=0$ if and only if $I=0$. The second counts the unit ideal. The zero ideal is excluded from the Dirichlet series itself, whose indices are $n\geq1$. Mathlib's `LSeries` makes its term at index zero equal to zero, independently of the raw coefficient there.

For $n\geq2$, define the actual prime-ideal von Mangoldt coefficient by

\[
\Lambda_K(n)=
\sum_{\substack{\mathfrak p\ne0\text{ prime}\;(N\mathfrak p)^k=n\\ k\geq1}}
\log N\mathfrak p,
\qquad \Lambda_K(0)=\Lambda_K(1)=0.
\]

For each fixed prime ideal the positive exponent, if it exists, is unique because $N\mathfrak p\geq2$. Thus this agrees with the source's finite support definition, which records each prime ideal once at an index.

The corresponding Euler-logarithm coefficient is

\[
b_K(n)=\frac{\Lambda_K(n)}{\log n}\quad(n\geq2),
\qquad b_K(0)=b_K(1)=0.
\]

Lean expresses the latter definition by totalized real division. Its zero/one vanishing is separately proved; no division by a nonzero logarithm is asserted at these indices.

**Source correspondence.** [IdealNormCoefficient.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/IdealNormCoefficient.lean) defines `idealNormFiber`, `idealNormCount`, and `idealNormCoefficient`. [IdealNormDivisibility.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/IdealNormDivisibility.lean) proves `idealNormFiber_card`, `idealNormCount_zero`, and `idealNormCount_one`. [PrimeIdealAnalyticDefs.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealAnalyticDefs.lean) defines the genuine `primeIdealVonMangoldt`. [PrimeIdealEulerLogAnalytic.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealEulerLogAnalytic.lean) defines `primeIdealLogCoefficient` and proves its vanishing, nonnegativity, and logarithmic multiplication identity. All these statements need only `[Field K] [NumberField K]`.

## 2. Finite ideal factorization and logarithmic convolution

For a nonzero ideal $I$, unique ideal factorization gives

\[
I=\prod_{\mathfrak p}\mathfrak p^{v_{\mathfrak p}(I)},\qquad
\mathfrak p^k\mid I\iff k\leq v_{\mathfrak p}(I).
\]

Here $v_{\mathfrak p}(I)$ is exactly the multiplicity of $\mathfrak p$ in `normalizedFactors I`. Multiplicativity of the absolute norm therefore gives the genuine finite formula

\[
\log NI=\sum_{\mathfrak p}v_{\mathfrak p}(I)\log N\mathfrak p
=\sum_{\mathfrak p}\sum_{\substack{k\geq1\\\mathfrak p^k\mid I}}\log N\mathfrak p.
\tag{2.1}
\]

If $NI=n>0$, every contributing prime ideal has $N\mathfrak p\leq n$. Also $(N\mathfrak p)^k\mid n$, so $(N\mathfrak p)^k\leq n$. Since $N\mathfrak p\geq2$ and $k\leq2^k$, every contributing exponent satisfies $k\leq n$. Thus (2.1) has exactly the finite cutoffs appearing in Lean:

\[
\log n=
\sum_{\substack{\mathfrak p\ne0\text{ prime}\\N\mathfrak p\leq n}}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf 1_{\mathfrak p^k\mid I}\log N\mathfrak p.
\tag{2.2}
\]

Next fix a nonzero integral ideal $A$. If $NA\mid n$, multiplication by $A$ gives a bijection

\[
\{J:NJ=n/NA\}\longrightarrow\{I:NI=n,\ A\mid I\},\qquad J\longmapsto AJ.
\]

Surjectivity is the divisibility witness $I=AJ$; injectivity follows from cancellation by the nonzero ideal $A$. Norm multiplicativity forces the quotient norm. If $NA\nmid n$, the target is empty. Consequently the number of multiples of $A$ in the norm-(n) fiber is

\[
\begin{cases}a_K(n/NA),&NA\mid n,\\0,&NA\nmid n.\end{cases}
\tag{2.3}
\]

The guard in (2.3) is essential. Dropping it would sometimes insert $a_K(0)=1$ where the actual fiber is empty.

Sum (2.2) over all ideals of norm $n>0$, exchange the finite sums, and apply (2.3) with $A=\mathfrak p^k$. Regroup the prime powers by $d=(N\mathfrak p)^k$. This yields

\[
a_K(n)\log n=\sum_{d\mid n}a_K(n/d)\Lambda_K(d).
\tag{2.4}
\]

At $n=1$, both sides are zero. At $n=0$, the actual Lean assertion is also zero on both sides: `Real.log 0 = 0`, while `LSeries.convolution` is defined through arithmetic-function conversion and has zero value at index zero. Equation (2.4) is therefore formalized for **all natural indices**, with its conventional positive-divisor interpretation for $n>0$.

**Source correspondence.** [IdealFactorLogarithm.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/IdealFactorLogarithm.lean) proves `ideal_prime_pow_dvd_iff_count`, `ideal_log_norm_eq_factor_sum`, and `ideal_log_norm_eq_prime_power_divisor_sum`. [IdealNormDivisibility.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/IdealNormDivisibility.lean) constructs `idealNormMulEquiv` and proves the guarded cardinality and weighted-count identities. [PrimeIdealLogConvolution.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealLogConvolution.lean) proves the exact all-index theorem `idealNormCoefficient_log_eq_convolution`. There is no analytic or Galois premise in these results.

## 3. Convergence, the actual zeta function, and its real pole

The inherited ideal-counting theorem gives

\[
\sum_{1\leq n\leq x}a_K(n)\sim\kappa_K x,
\qquad
\kappa_K=
\frac{2^{r_1}(2\pi)^{r_2}R_Kh_K}{w_K\sqrt{|D_K|}}>0.
\tag{3.1}
\]

The notation is the usual number of real and complex places, regulator, class number, torsion-unit order, and discriminant. In Lean this positive constant is `NumberField.dedekindZeta_residue K`. Equation (3.1) is a mathlib ideal-counting foundation, not a prime-ideal PNT and not the class-field-theory reciprocity input used later.

In particular the nonnegative partial sums of $a_K$ are (O(x)). Partial summation implies absolute convergence of

\[
\zeta_K(s)=\sum_{n\geq1}a_K(n)n^{-s}
\tag{3.2}
\]

for $\Re s>1$. It is precisely mathlib's actual `NumberField.dedekindZeta K`, with holomorphy in that half-plane. For real $s>1$, the sum is real and strictly positive, since $a_K(1)=1$ and all coefficients are nonnegative. Thus division by $\zeta_K(s)$ on this real interval is justified.

The actual prime-ideal coefficients also satisfy

\[
0\leq\Lambda_K(n)\leq m\Lambda(n),
\tag{3.3}
\]

where $\Lambda$ is the ordinary rational von Mangoldt function. To see the bound at $n=p^r$, write $N\mathfrak p=p^{f_{\mathfrak p}}$ for contributing prime ideals. Their logarithmic weights sum to

\[
\left(\sum_{\mathfrak p\text{ contributing}}f_{\mathfrak p}\right)\log p
\leq m\log p,
\]

because the ramification-inertia identity $\sum e_{\mathfrak p}f_{\mathfrak p}=m$, with $e_{\mathfrak p}\geq1$, bounds the sum of the inertia degrees. Outside rational-prime powers, the coefficient is zero. This proof requires no Galois assumption. The elementary rational Chebyshev bound then supplies the needed convergent prime-ideal coefficient series for $\Re s>1$.

The same ideal-counting theorem supplies the real right-pole asymptotic

\[
\lim_{s\downarrow1}(s-1)\zeta_K(s)=\kappa_K>0.
\tag{3.4}
\]

This is a statement along the real axis. A complex meromorphic continuation across $s=1$, or nonvanishing on the line $\Re s=1$, is not inferred from it.

**Source correspondence.** [IdealNormAnalytic.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/IdealNormAnalytic.lean) proves `idealNormCoefficient_tendsto_sum_div`, `idealNormCoefficient_sum_isBigO`, `idealNormCoefficient_LSeriesSummable`, `dedekindZeta_eq_idealNormCoefficient_LSeries`, real positivity/nonvanishing, and `actualDedekindZeta_tendsto_sub_one_mul_nhdsGT`. The latter explicitly invokes mathlib's `NumberField.tendsto_sub_one_mul_dedekindZeta_nhdsGT`. [PrimeIdealVonMangoldtBound.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealVonMangoldtBound.lean) proves (3.3); [PrimeIdealChebyshev.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealChebyshev.lean) proves the resulting `primeIdealLSeriesSummable`. These results all apply to arbitrary number fields.

## 4. From convolution to the real Euler-logarithm identity

Multiply absolutely convergent Dirichlet series in $\Re s>1$. The exact finite convolution (2.4) gives

\[
\zeta_K(s)\sum_{n\geq1}\Lambda_K(n)n^{-s}
=\sum_{n\geq1}a_K(n)\log n\,n^{-s}
=-\zeta_K'(s).
\tag{4.1}
\]

Only convergence inside this half-plane is used. The product identity does not require complex nonvanishing. On the real interval $s>1$, the positivity established above allows division by $\zeta_K(s)$.

For $n\geq2$, (3.3) and $\Lambda(n)\leq\log n$ imply $0\leq b_K(n)\leq m$. Hence

\[
B_K(s)=\sum_{n\geq1}b_K(n)n^{-s}
\]

converges absolutely in $\Re s>1$, and differentiation there gives

\[
B_K'(s)=-\sum_{n\geq1}\Lambda_K(n)n^{-s}.
\]

Combining this with (4.1), the real function

\[
F(s)=\log\zeta_K(s)-B_K(s),\qquad s>1,
\]

has derivative zero. Here both series are real on the real axis, and the logarithm is the real logarithm of the positive real zeta value. Thus $F$ is constant on the connected interval $(1,\infty)$.

As real $s\to\infty$, $\zeta_K(s)\to a_K(1)=1$ and $B_K(s)\to b_K(1)=0$. For example, both limits follow by dominated convergence after fixing any exponent $s_0>1$ and using the summable majorants at $s_0$. The constant is therefore zero:

\[
\boxed{\log\zeta_K(s)=B_K(s)\quad(s>1).}
\tag{4.2}
\]

This proves the real Euler-logarithm identity from the finite ideal convolution; it does not postulate an Euler product. Combining (4.2) with the positive real pole (3.4) gives

\[
B_K(s)+\log(s-1)\longrightarrow\log\kappa_K
\quad(s\downarrow1).
\tag{4.3}
\]

Since $\log(1/(s-1))\to\infty$, it follows that

\[
\frac{B_K(s)}{\log(1/(s-1))}\longrightarrow1.
\tag{4.4}
\]

**Source correspondence.** [PrimeIdealLogDerivative.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealLogDerivative.lean) proves (4.1) as `actualDedekindZeta_mul_primeIdealLSeries_eq_neg_deriv` for every complex `s` with `1 < s.re`; real division is the separately justified `primeIdealLSeries_eq_neg_dedekindZeta_logDerivative_real`. [PrimeIdealEulerLogAnalytic.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealEulerLogAnalytic.lean) supplies the derivative and limits at infinity. [PrimeIdealEulerLogIdentity.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealEulerLogIdentity.lean) proves `actualDedekindZeta_real_log_eq_eulerLog`, whose literal statement uses the real part of the actual complex zeta value and the real part of the Euler-logarithm `LSeries`. [PrimeIdealEulerLogRealPole.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealEulerLogRealPole.lean) proves (4.3), and [PrimeIdealSplitDirichlet.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealSplitDirichlet.lean) proves (4.4).

## 5. Galois splitting coefficients and a bounded genuine remainder

Now additionally assume $K/\mathbb Q$ is Galois. Let

\[
\Sigma_K=\{p\text{ rational prime}:p\text{ is unramified in }K
\text{ and splits completely in }K\}.
\]

This is the actual set `completelySplittingRationalPrimes K`. Its definition includes primality and unramifiedness. Complete splitting means that **every actual prime ideal above $p$** has ramification index and inertia degree equal to one.

At a rational prime $p$, $b_K(p)$ counts exactly the prime ideals of norm $p$. For unramified $p$ in a Galois extension, all inertia degrees agree. The existence of one norm-$p$ prime therefore forces all inertia degrees to be one, hence complete splitting. The ramification-inertia identity then shows that there are exactly $m$ such prime ideals. If $p$ does not split completely, there is no degree-one prime ideal. Thus

\[
b_K(p)=m\mathbf1_{\Sigma_K}(p)
\quad\text{for unramified rational primes }p.
\tag{5.1}
\]

Define the genuine residual coefficient

\[
r_K(n)=b_K(n)-m\mathbf1_{\Sigma_K}(n).
\]

By (5.1) this is the sum of two nonnegative parts: the part at nonprime indices and the part at ramified rational primes. The ramified-prime part has finite support, since such primes divide the nonzero discriminant $D_K$.

For the nonprime part $c_K(n)=\mathbf1_{\neg\mathrm{Prime}(n)}b_K(n)$, (3.3) gives

\[
\sum_{n\leq x}c_K(n)
\leq\frac{m}{\log2}\bigl(\psi(x)-\theta(x)\bigr).
\]

The elementary rational prime-power error estimate

\[
|\psi(x)-\theta(x)|\leq2\sqrt{x}\log x\quad(x\geq1)
\]

implies that these partial sums are $O(x^{3/4})$. Indeed $\log x=o(x^{1/4})$. Partial summation, with an exponent strictly below one, proves

\[
\sum_{n\geq1}\frac{c_K(n)}n<\infty.
\]

The finite ramified part can be added, yielding the actual finite constant

\[
C_K=\sum_{n\geq1}\frac{r_K(n)}n<\infty,
\qquad C_K\geq0.
\]

For real $s>1$, nonnegativity and $n^{-s}\leq n^{-1}$ show

\[
0\leq R_K(s):=\sum_{n\geq1}r_K(n)n^{-s}\leq C_K.
\tag{5.2}
\]

Consequently the exact series decomposition is

\[
B_K(s)=m\sum_{p\in\Sigma_K}p^{-s}+R_K(s),\qquad s>1.
\tag{5.3}
\]

Every term here has been defined from actual ideal norms and actual prime membership. In particular $C_K$ is a proved convergent residual sum, not an assumed analytic error constant.

**Source correspondence.** [ArithmeticPrimeIdealCounting.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/ArithmeticPrimeIdealCounting.lean) defines `RationalPrimeSplitsCompletely` and proves the Galois unramified norm-prime fiber formula. [PrimeIdealEulerLogRemainder.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealEulerLogRemainder.lean) proves `primeIdealLogCoefficient_eq_primeNormFiber_card` without a Galois hypothesis, then `primeIdealLogCoefficient_eq_split_indicator` with `[IsGalois ℚ K]` and an explicit unramified-prime hypothesis. It proves the nonprime (3/4)-power bound for every number field, the Galois residual decomposition, convergence at exponent one, and `primeIdealEulerLogRemainderSeries_bounds`. Its `primeIdealEulerLogRemainderBound` is exactly $C_K$. [PrimeIdealSplitDirichlet.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealSplitDirichlet.lean) proves the real transport and (5.3) as `primeIdealEulerLogLSeries_re_eq_split_add_remainder`.

## 6. Actual splitting Dirichlet density, including finite conductor removal

Divide (5.3) by $\log(1/(s-1))$, use (4.4), and use the bounded remainder (5.2). Since $m>0$,

\[
\boxed{\lim_{s\downarrow1}
\frac{\sum_{p\in\Sigma_K}p^{-s}}{\log(1/(s-1))}=\frac1m.}
\tag{6.1}
\]

For any fixed $f\in\mathbb N$, let $\Sigma_{K,f}=\{p\in\Sigma_K:f<p\}$. The exact removed difference is a finite sum over $n\leq f$, nonnegative and bounded by $f+1$ for every real $s>1$. Dividing by the same divergent logarithm gives zero, so

\[
\lim_{s\downarrow1}
\frac{\sum_{p\in\Sigma_{K,f}}p^{-s}}{\log(1/(s-1))}=\frac1m.
\tag{6.2}
\]

For this analytic finite-removal statement $f$ can be any natural number; positivity of the conductor is needed only in the later order/ray-modulus construction.

For a set $P\subseteq\mathbb N$, put $S_P(s)=\sum_{p\in P}p^{-s}$, interpreted in Lean through the actual membership indicator. `PositiveUpperDirichletSupply P` asserts that some $d>0$ satisfies

\[
\forall\eta>0\ \exists\varepsilon\in(0,\min(\eta,1/2)):
\quad d\log(1/\varepsilon)\leq S_P(1+\varepsilon).
\tag{6.3}
\]

Any positive limit in (6.1) or (6.2) gives (6.3), with $d=1/(2m)$. A genuine limit yields eventual lower values near one; the exported interface deliberately retains only the cofinal property (6.3).

**Source correspondence.** The exact density theorem is `completelySplittingRationalPrimes_DirichletSeries_normalized_tendsto` in [PrimeIdealSplitDirichlet.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealSplitDirichlet.lean), with `[Field K] [NumberField K] [IsGalois ℚ K]`. [PrimeIdealSplitDirichletCutoff.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/PrimeIdealSplitDirichletCutoff.lean) proves the finite difference identity and bound, (6.2), `positiveUpperDirichletSupply_of_normalized_tendsto`, and `completelySplittingRationalPrimes_aboveCutoff_positiveUpperDirichletSupply`. The definition (6.3) is in [WeakSupplyInterfaces.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyInterfaces.lean).

## 7. A prime-specific dyadic upper estimate

For the remainder of the analytic argument, $P$ is **any set of actual rational primes**, with the explicit hypothesis $\forall p\in P,\ p\text{ is prime}$. No field or Galois hypothesis enters this generic step. Assume only (6.3).

Let

\[
\mathcal B_j(P)=\{p\in P:2^j\leq p\leq2^{j+1}\},\qquad
k_j=\#\mathcal B_j(P),\qquad u_j=k_j/2^j.
\]

These are the source's actual closed `dyadicPrimeBatch` intervals. They need not be disjoint: an endpoint can occur in two batches. The argument requires an upper bound, and the source assigns each prime to $j=\lfloor\log_2 p\rfloor$ before enlarging its fiber to a batch, so endpoint overlap is harmless.

The elementary Chebyshev upper bound $\theta(x)\leq(\log4)x$ gives, for $j\geq1$,

\[
k_j j\log2\leq\sum_{p\in\mathcal B_j(P)}\log p
\leq(\log4)2^{j+1}=4(\log2)2^j.
\]

Cancel $\log2>0$. Since $j+1\leq2j$,

\[
k_j\leq\frac{8\,2^j}{j+1},\qquad
0\leq u_j\leq\frac8{j+1}.
\tag{7.1}
\]

For $j=0$, the finite range defining the batch has at most three elements, which supplies the same loose bound. Hence (7.1) holds for all $j\geq0$.

Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and put $q=2^{-\varepsilon}=e^{-(\log2)\varepsilon}\in(0,1)$. A batch term satisfies

\[
\sum_{p\in\mathcal B_j(P)}p^{-(1+\varepsilon)}\leq u_jq^j.
\]

The right-hand series is summable, since $u_jq^j\leq8q^j$. Finite regrouping by the integer binary logarithm, followed by passage to the nonnegative sum, proves

\[
S_P(1+\varepsilon)\leq\sum_{j\geq0}u_jq^j.
\tag{7.2}
\]

**Source correspondence.** [WeakSupplyDyadicChebyshev.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyDyadicChebyshev.lean) proves `supply_dyadicPrimeBatch_card_le` and the per-batch Dirichlet estimate from actual Chebyshev prime-log mass. [WeakSupplyDyadicSeries.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyDyadicSeries.lean) extends the cap to all indices, proves summability, proves actual membership in the binary-log batch, and proves (7.2) as `supplyPrimeDirichletSeries_le_dyadic`. The actual-prime hypothesis is indispensable to the Chebyshev step; the theorem is not asserted for arbitrary integer sets.

## 8. The exact cutoff bound and its constants

For a fixed $\delta\geq0$, define

\[
G(P,\delta,J)=\left\{j\in\mathbb N:2\leq j\leq J,
\quad \frac{\delta2^j}{\log(2^{j+1})}\leq k_j\right\},
\qquad
H(P,\delta,J)=\sum_{j\in G(P,\delta,J)}\frac1{j+1}.
\]

This is exactly `goodDyadicBins P δ J`; the lower cutoff is two, not zero or one. For a bad bin, division of the defining strict failure by $2^j$ gives

\[
u_j\leq\frac{\delta/\log2}{j+1}.
\]

For a good bin, use (7.1). Since $q^j\leq1$, for $J\geq2$,

\[
\sum_{j=0}^{J}u_jq^j
\leq16+\frac{\delta}{\log2}\sum_{j=2}^{J}\frac1{j+1}
+8H(P,\delta,J).
\tag{8.1}
\]

The constant 16 bounds the two initial bins by eight each. For the harmonic interval, the elementary inequality

\[
\frac1{x+1}\leq\log(x+1)-\log x\quad(x>0)
\]

telescopes to $\sum_{j=1}^{J}1/(j+1)\leq\log(J+1)$. For $J\geq1$, $\log(J+1)\leq\log J+\log2\leq\log J+1$. Thus

\[
\sum_{j=2}^{J}\frac1{j+1}\leq1+\log J.
\tag{8.2}
\]

There is also an explicit uniform tail bound. If $0<\varepsilon<1/2$, then $q\geq1/2$ and $1/2\leq\log2\leq1$. With $t=(\log2)\varepsilon$, the elementary bound $1+t\leq e^t$, multiplied by $q=e^{-t}$, gives

\[
1-q\geq tq\geq\varepsilon/4,
\qquad \frac{\varepsilon}{1-q}\leq4.
\tag{8.3}
\]

For any nonnegative sequence $a_j\leq1/(j+1)$, if $\varepsilon N\geq1$, then $a_{N+n}\leq\varepsilon$ and $q^{N+n}\leq q^n$. Therefore

\[
\sum_{n\geq0}a_{N+n}q^{N+n}
\leq\varepsilon\sum_{n\geq0}q^n
=\frac{\varepsilon}{1-q}\leq4.
\tag{8.4}
\]

Apply (8.4) to $a_j=u_j/8$, justified by (7.1), and take $N=J+1$. Whenever $\varepsilon(J+1)\geq1$, the tail in (7.2) is at most $32=8\cdot4$. Combining (7.2), (8.1), and (8.2) gives the source's exact estimate

\[
\boxed{S_P(1+\varepsilon)\leq
48+\frac{\delta}{\log2}(1+\log J)+8H(P,\delta,J).}
\tag{8.5}
\]

Its hypotheses are precisely: actual-prime membership for $P$, $\delta\geq0$, $0<\varepsilon<1/2$, $J\geq2$, and $1\leq\varepsilon(J+1)$. The constant 48 is $16+32$. No density, asymptotic prime count, or Tauberian statement is a premise of (8.5).

**Source correspondence.** [WeakSupplyGoodBinUpper.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyGoodBinUpper.lean) proves the bad-bin ratio and exact finite good/bad split, including the 16 term. [WeakSupplyElementaryDiscount.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyElementaryDiscount.lean) proves (8.2), (8.3), geometric summability, and the generic capped tail (8.4). [WeakSupplyDirichletCutoff.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyDirichletCutoff.lean) proves the 32 tail and (8.5) as `supplyPrimeDirichletSeries_le_good_bin_cutoff`.

## 9. Fixed positive density and cofinal positive logarithmic mass

Let $d>0$ witness the cofinal Dirichlet lower property (6.3). Choose the **fixed**, endpoint-independent constants

\[
\boxed{\delta=\frac{d\log2}{4}>0,\qquad \beta=\frac d{64}>0.}
\tag{9.1}
\]

Given any $J_0\in\mathbb N$, put

\[
M=\max(J_0,2),\qquad T=256/d+4,
\qquad \eta=\min\left(\frac1{M+1},e^{-T}\right)>0.
\]

Use (6.3) to choose $0<\varepsilon<\min(\eta,1/2)$ with $d\log(1/\varepsilon)\leq S_P(1+\varepsilon)$, and take the actual natural cutoff

\[
J=\left\lceil\frac1\varepsilon\right\rceil.
\]

Then $J\geq M$, $J\geq2$, and $\varepsilon(J+1)\geq1$. Because $\varepsilon<1/2$,

\[
J\leq2/\varepsilon,\qquad
Y:=\log J\leq L+1,\quad L:=\log(1/\varepsilon).
\tag{9.2}
\]

The choice $\varepsilon<e^{-T}$ gives

\[
dL\geq256+4d.
\tag{9.3}
\]

Apply (8.5), use $\delta/\log2=d/4$, and write $H=H(P,\delta,J)$. The Dirichlet lower value and the cutoff upper estimate imply

\[
8H\geq dL-48-\frac d4(1+Y)
\geq\frac{3d}{4}L-48-\frac d2.
\]

By (9.2) and (9.3),

\[
8H-\frac d8Y
\geq\frac{5d}{8}L-48-\frac{5d}{8}
\geq112+\frac{15d}{8}>0.
\]

In particular $H\geq(d/64)\log J=\beta\log J$. We have proved exactly

\[
\exists\delta>0\ \exists\beta>0\ \forall J_0\in\mathbb N\quad
\exists J\geq\max(J_0,2):
\quad\beta\log J\leq
\sum_{j\in G(P,\delta,J)}\frac1{j+1}.
\tag{9.4}
\]

The constants $\delta$ and $\beta$ are fixed before $J_0$. Only the chosen $\varepsilon$ and $J$ depend on $J_0$. The conclusion is cofinal harmonic mass of actual good bins. It neither states that every sufficiently large endpoint works nor asserts that all sufficiently large individual bins are good.

**Exact Lean endpoint.** [WeakSupplyDirichletGoodBins.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyDirichletGoodBins.lean) proves

```lean
positiveUpperLogGoodBinSupply_of_positiveUpperDirichletSupply
  (P : Set ℕ) (hP : ∀ p ∈ P, Nat.Prime p)
  (hD : PositiveUpperDirichletSupply P) :
  PositiveUpperLogGoodBinSupply P
```

This is the literal interface in [WeakSupplyInterfaces.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakSupplyInterfaces.lean), including `Finset.Icc 2 J` and the weight `1 / $(j : ℝ) + 1$`.

## 10. Where conductor orders and class field theory enter

Fix a quadratic number field $K$, so $[K:\mathbb Q]=2$, and a positive integer $f$. Its actual order is $O_f=\mathbb Z+fO_K\subseteq K$, the literal `conductorOrder K f`.

The arithmetic extraction uses a realization of the ray class field for the **finite modulus associated to the ideal ((f))**, with empty infinite part. This realization and reciprocity are inherited class-field-theory theorems. They supply a finite abelian ray extension (L/K). Choose an actual finite normal closure $N/\mathbb Q$ containing $L$; $N$ is a number field and is Galois over $\mathbb Q$.

Take the actual rational-prime set

\[
P=\{p\in\Sigma_N:f<p\}.
\]

By (6.2), applied to the Galois field $N$, it has normalized Dirichlet limit $1/[N:\mathbb Q]>0$, hence positive upper Dirichlet supply. Every member is a genuine rational prime. Notice that the analytic field here is the normal closure $N$, not an unsupported assertion of splitting density for an arbitrary non-Galois ray extension.

Complete splitting in $N$ descends to a degree-one unramified prime $v$ of $K$ splitting in (L/K). The condition $p>f$, with $f>0$, keeps $v$ outside the conductor modulus: membership in its support would imply $p\mid f$, hence $p\leq f$. Ray reciprocity and the actual integral generator theorem therefore give a generator $a\in O_K$ for $v$, with $f\mid a-1$. Thus $a\in O_f$. Its principal ideal in $O_K$ has norm $p$, so its determinant norm in the conductor order has absolute value $p$.

The nonidentity quadratic automorphism $\tau$ gives the conjugate generator. The frozen elementary conductor assembly proves the two actual principal kernels, conjugacy, the paired intersection condition corresponding to $pO_f$, and the unital residue maps to $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$. These are precisely the non-density witnesses retained in `WeakPrincipalSplitPrimeSupplyTarget`; their norm, kernel, conjugation, paired-ideal, and ring-map statements are not discarded when the supply is weakened.

**Source correspondence.** The external [ArithmeticSupplyWeakFromDirichlet.lean](../../project/lean/references/upstream/arithmetic-audit/ArithmeticSupplyWeakFromDirichlet.lean) proves `arithmeticSupply_weak_conductor_primeTo_of_gt` and the closed `arithmeticSupply_weakPrincipalSupply_from_Dirichlet : WeakPrincipalSplitPrimeSupplyTarget`. It explicitly invokes `rayClassField_reciprocity`, the finite normal-closure package, the new finite-cutoff splitting Dirichlet supply, and `arithmeticSupply_ray_split_conductor_generator` from [ArithmeticSupplyRayConductor.lean](../../project/lean/references/upstream/arithmetic-audit/ArithmeticSupplyRayConductor.lean). The actual conductor witnesses are assembled in [ArithmeticWeakPrincipalSupplyAssembly.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/ArithmeticWeakPrincipalSupplyAssembly.lean). The all-conductor target is spelled out in [WeakPrincipalSupply.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakPrincipalSupply.lean): it universally quantifies every quadratic $K$ and every $f>0$.

For this particular set $P$, the normalized limit permits $d=1/(2[N:\mathbb Q])$. The generic bridge then permits the explicit witnesses $delta=\log2/(8[N:\mathbb Q])$ and $\beta=1/(128[N:\mathbb Q])$. These constants are not claimed uniform in $K$ or $f$, since the ray field and its normal closure depend on them.

## 11. Endpoint correspondence and the review trust boundary

The traditional proof above establishes the analytic supply used by the weak geometric route. The geometric entropy/common-law proof is a separate argument, not reproduced here. Its frozen endpoint is

```lean
Entry002.WeakA5.core_finite_sieve_of_log_good_bins
```

in [WeakCoreGoodBinFiniteSieve.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakCoreGoodBinFiniteSieve.lean). It takes `ArithmeticCore` (the former A1–A4 assumptions) and `PositiveUpperLogGoodBinSupply data.primes`, and concludes, for every $D\geq0$, a finite actual prime pool $S\subseteq\mathrm{data.primes}$ with the literal $Q^2$ component bound, $Q=\prod_{p\in S}p$. The pool is chosen before the walk quantifiers. [WeakFiniteSieveConsequences.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakFiniteSieveConsequences.lean) combines that engine with the prime-specific analytic bridge and exposes closed proofs of `WeakFiniteSieveTarget` and `WeakFiniteSieveNoWalkTarget`.

The separately compiled external [ArithmeticSupplyWeakMain.lean](../../project/lean/references/upstream/arithmetic-audit/ArithmeticSupplyWeakMain.lean) exposes `arithmeticSupply_mainTarget_proved : MainTarget`, combining the all-conductor weak principal supply, the weak finite-sieve theorem, and [WeakAssembly.lean](../../project/lean/Entry002/WeakAssembly.lean). Its target retains every quadratic number field, positive conductor, actual integral basis, full real planar linear isomorphism, and nonnegative step bound. The final restoration to the irreducible graph is distinct from the analytic proof above.

Three forms of evidence should be distinguished:

1. **This written proof** is a conventional derivation matched to the frozen statements and explicit hypotheses. It is not a new compiler run, a second-kernel check, or a replacement for verification of source/object bindings.
2. **The owned Lean proofs** provide explicit theorem bodies for ideal-fiber convolution, convergence and real Euler-logarithm transport, residual bounds, splitting Dirichlet supply, and the fixed-density good-bin bridge. The frozen [compiled endpoint report](../../project/lean/COMPILED-ENDPOINTS.md), [overall verification record](../../project/lean/overall-verification.json), and recorded compilation/audit logs are the existing evidence for their compilation and stored-body closures. The five dyadic/good-bin modules have recorded direct final `EXIT=0` runs in [r5-weak-dirichlet-goodbins-final.log](../../project/lean/logs/r5-weak-dirichlet-goodbins-final.log), and their recorded axiom probe reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` in [r5-weak-dirichlet-goodbins-axioms.log](../../project/lean/logs/r5-weak-dirichlet-goodbins-axioms.log).
3. **Inherited foundations** include official pinned mathlib ideal counting, real-pole and calculus results, and the separately pinned imported class-field-theory realization/reciprocity closure. CFT enters the all-conductor generator extraction, not the generic prime-specific Dirichlet-to-good-bin argument. The frozen candidate does not claim a fresh 995-module rebuild of the CFT closure, a full mathlib rebuild, or a second kernel. Its documented compiler is Lean 4.34.1, and its official mathlib pin is `d13f23b723b8a846827a245b89c10fc7d3f11612`.

The old strong supply target `PrincipalSplitPrimeSupplyTarget` and the universal natural prime-ideal PNT target `NumberFieldPrimeIdealPNTTarget` remain without proofs in this candidate. Nothing in (6.1) or (9.4) proves a natural prime-counting asymptotic or the old eventual dyadic-density A5 field. The closed weak-route endpoint can imply the unchanged literal `MainTarget` through its own arithmetic and geometric assembly while leaving those stronger historical intermediates open.

Some preserved definition-file comments still describe weak propositions as open. Their formal status in the frozen candidate is determined by the explicit proof declarations above, not by those historical comments. This document makes no claim about a new publication, a computational finite-certificate algorithm, or a proof of the original natural PNT.
